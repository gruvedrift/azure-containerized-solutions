## Business Context
**Scenario**: Your development team needs a private, secure location to store Docker images for your proprietary applications. Using Docker Hub isn't an option due to corporate security policies.

**What This Solves**:
- Provides a private container registry within your Azure subscription
- Ensures images remain within your organization's security boundary
- Enables integration with other Azure services using managed identities
- Supports automated image vulnerability scanning (with Premium SKU)

## Technical Implementation
This iteration demonstrates provisioning:
- **Azure Resource Group** (logical container for resources)
- **Azure Container Registry** (private Docker registry)
